## Hi there 👋

I'm Anne, a software engineer based in Seattle, WA 🌲. Coming from a biology background, I take a detail-oriented approach to development, and I'm always excited to collaborate on projects at the intersection of science and technology.

When I'm not coding, I love to ski, knit, and figure out how plants work.

---

### What I'm up to:

🐦 I'm currently working on an app that allows birdwatchers to access forecasts about bird migration.

🌱 Another recent project I worked on was Flora, a community for plant lovers built using React and Node.JS.

👩‍💻 Prior to that, I built [Arroyo](https://www.arroyoframework.com/), a framework that facilitates the granular rehydration of logs, with a small team of other great engineers.

### What I've got experience with:

*Languages*: JS, TS, C#, SQL, Go, Ruby, Python, Rust, HTML/CSS, Java, Bash

*Technologies*: PostgreSQL, Docker, MongoDB, Nginx, Node.JS, RESTful APIs, Git/Github, Postman

*Frameworks*: React/Redux, MUI, Jest, Express, Sinatra, Vue, Nuxt.js, Tailwind

*Cloud*: AWS (ECS, Fargate, ECR, Lambda, S3, SQS, IAM, EC2), Heroku, DigitalOcean
